hw6

Implemented all function required by the specific way.

- In order to help debugging and help you to test, the actual number is shown in console.log.

- If your guess number is close to the actual number, the hint will use "slightly" to help your guessing.

- Button will be disbled once the input is not number, reason is iin the next description.

- Textfield will first check if the input is number or not, and then send it to backend.
However, I think the input should be checked before sent to backend, including if the number is in range or not, this is to reduce the work of backend. But hw6 specify that catch() must be used, so that I still let backend to judge if the number is in range.

- First time using material desgin component with customized design. Next time will try to use theme to customize material design as customizing component one by one with material is not very easy and not effective.
